Interface Description: Ten One Tea House Tablet Ordering System
Introduction
Welcome to my UX research journey exploring the tablet ordering system at Ten One Tea House, a popular boba shop in my area. This project dives into how real customers interact with digital ordering interfaces in food service environments. Through careful observation, interviews, and analysis, I've created personas and storyboards that capture the essence of the user experience. Join me as I uncover insights about user behavior, pain points, and opportunities for improvement in this increasingly common restaurant technology.
The Interface
The Ten One Tea House ordering system consists of a tablet mounted on a stand positioned at the counter, creating an interactive self-service experience for customers. This setup allows patrons to browse, customize, and place their orders without staff assistance, streamlining the ordering process during busy hours.
The interface follows a logical four-step flow designed to guide users from login to checkout. When approaching the tablet, customers first encounter a welcome screen divided into two sections: a rewards panel displaying current promotions through an eye-catching slideshow, and a phone number entry pad. This initial screen serves dual purposes - entering your number enrolls you in their reward program and text marketing while also providing a way to receive order notifications.
After entering their information (or skipping this step), customers navigate to the menu page. This screen thoughtfully splits into a sidebar categorizing drink types on the left (milk teas, fruit teas, etc.) and the main content area on the right displaying the actual drink options. This categorical organization helps users quickly find what they're looking for without endless scrolling - a small but important detail for reducing decision fatigue.
The drink customization page appears after selecting a beverage, presenting a visually appealing image of the chosen drink on the left side while offering customization options on the right. Here, customers can personalize their experience by adjusting quantity, size, milk type, and ice level with simple taps. The visual layout creates a natural connection between the product image and the modifications being made.
Finally, the checkout page displays a complete summary of the order with line items, prices, and a total. Users can make last-minute adjustments before finalizing their purchase with the prominently displayed "Check Out" button. After payment, customers receive an order number for pickup, completing the digital journey from selection to confirmation.
What makes this interface particularly effective is how it mirrors the conversational flow you'd have with a barista - starting with identification, moving to selection, then customization, and finally confirmation - all while giving users complete control over their ordering experience.

Simulated Interview Responses
Interview 1: Alex, 19, Sophomore
Q1: How often do you visit Ten One Tea House, and have you used their tablet ordering system before?
"I come here like twice a week, usually between classes. Yeah, I've used the tablet thing pretty much every time. It's way better than waiting in line to order from a person."
Q2: Walk me through your typical ordering process.
"So I just walk up, skip the phone number part because I don't want spam texts, browse through the fruit tea section, get my usual passion fruit tea with lychee jelly, adjust the ice to less ice, then checkout. Takes like 30 seconds if I know what I want."
Q3: What aspects of the tablet ordering system do you find most helpful?
"Honestly, I just like that I don't have to talk to people. I'm already talking to professors all day, so it's nice to just tap a few buttons and be done. Plus I can take my time looking at all the options without feeling rushed."
Q4: Have you experienced any challenges while using the tablet?
"Yeah, sometimes I accidentally add the wrong drink and then I have to start all over because I can't figure out how to remove just one item. Also, one time the screen was super dirty and my touches weren't registering right."
Q5: How do you feel about entering your phone number?
"I never do it. They'll just spam me with texts, and I don't need another loyalty program in my life. They call out the order number anyway so I don't see the point."
Q6: When customizing your drink, how easy is it to find options?
"It's pretty straightforward. I like that I can see all the options at once. The milk options are kinda confusing though, like what's the difference between 'milk' and 'fresh milk'? That always trips me up."
Q7: If you could improve one thing, what would it be?
"Add a back button that actually works! Sometimes I tap the wrong thing and want to go back, but it either doesn't work or I lose everything I've selected. Super annoying."
Interview 2: Maya, 21, Junior
Q1: How often do you visit Ten One Tea House, and have you used their tablet ordering system?
"I'm here at least once a week. The tablet is convenient but sometimes I miss talking to the staff who would recommend stuff."
Q2: Walk me through your typical ordering process.
"I usually put in my phone number because I'm trying to get enough points for a free drink. Then I look through the seasonal specials first to see if there's anything new. If not, I go for my usual brown sugar milk tea, extra boba, less ice. Then checkout and wait for my text."
Q3: What aspects of the tablet ordering system do you find most helpful?
"It's fast, and I like that I can see everything at once. When it's super busy between classes, I can get my order in quickly and then go sit down instead of standing in line. Also, I appreciate seeing the pictures of drinks I haven't tried before."
Q4: Have you experienced any challenges?
"Sometimes the system is just slow to respond, and I'm standing there tapping like an idiot. Also, I wish it remembered my past orders so I didn't have to go through all the customization steps every single time for my usual drink."
Q5: How do you feel about entering your phone number?
"I do it for the rewards, but it's kind of annoying how they text me deals like three times a week. The notification for when my drink is ready is useful though, especially when it's crowded and I can't hear them call the number."
Q6: When customizing your drink, how easy is it to find options?
"It's okay. I wish they'd organize the toppings better though. Like put all the jellies together, all the boba types together. Right now it feels random and I have to scan the whole list."
Q7: If you could improve one thing, what would it be?
"I wish it would save my favorites or recent orders. I get the same thing 90% of the time, so it would save me so much time if I could just tap 'reorder my usual' or something."
Interview 3: Jayden, 20, Sophomore
Q1: How often do you visit Ten One Tea House, and have you used their tablet ordering system?
"I'm here like every other day, man. Their taro milk tea is getting me through this semester. Yeah, I use the tablet every time."
Q2: Walk me through your typical ordering process.
"I just walk up, punch in my number real quick, hit the milk tea category, scroll down to taro, max out the sugar because I need the energy, then checkout. Super fast, which is good cause I'm usually running late to something."
Q3: What aspects of the tablet ordering system do you find most helpful?
"It's just efficient. No miscommunications like when I try to order verbally and they mishear my customizations. What I select is what I get, so that's cool. Also, I can see exactly how much it costs before I commit."
Q4: Have you experienced any challenges?
"The worst is when the tablet freezes up mid-order and I have to flag someone down to reset it. Also, I hate that I can't split payment between cards. My girlfriend and I like to split the bill but we can't do that on the tablet."
Q5: How do you feel about entering your phone number?
"I'm fine with it. The text when my drink is ready is clutch because I can just chill on my phone instead of hovering around the pickup counter. I've never gotten any spam from them either, just my order notification."
Q6: When customizing your drink, how easy is it to find options?
"The ice and sugar levels are easy, but I wish the toppings section was better. Sometimes I want to add multiple toppings but it's not obvious how to do that. I had to ask for help the first time."
Q7: If you could improve one thing, what would it be?
"The order status thing needs work. I get a text that my drink is ready, but when I go up, half the time it's not actually done yet. There should be a display showing order numbers and their status so I know where mine is in the queue."
